	<description>Introducing the latest mobile armor technology on the rim -- people! That's right, you can now take cover behind your own fellow man.
	
&lt;size=24&gt;Tactical Ablative Armor&lt;/size&gt;
 
(In other words, meat shields, but they don't need to know that)
 
All humanoid pawns now provide cover for adjacent pawns. The amount of cover provided depends on the body type of the pawn.
 
By default, these values are:
 
 - Fat/Hulk: 90% cover
 - Male/Female: 50% cover
 - Thin: 30% cover
 
These values (including bodyTypes added by other mods) are tweakable in the mod settings, up to a maximum of 99% cover. Downed pawns also provide this cover, however corpses do not (yet).
 
I highly suggest giving good armor to your meat shields. While this doesn't increase the cover they provide, it does improve their survivability. Also, give them red shirts.
 
&lt;size=24&gt;Integrations&lt;/size&gt;
 
Humanoid Alien Races: Adds a default cover provider for alien races. 
 
&lt;size=24&gt;Dependencies&lt;/size&gt;
 
Requires Harmony.
 
&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
 
Please report any issues on the github issue tracker.
